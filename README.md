My name is John (Jack) Iacono, most call me Jack, but I am okay with either. I mostly code for fun, but am also studying at Marist and hope to graduate with a Bachelors in Games and Emerging Media

Most of these projects were created with the sole purpose of gaining expirience with the various genres that they are associated with. If any of my work is of interest to you, or if you would like to send any constructive critisism, please feel free to let me know.
